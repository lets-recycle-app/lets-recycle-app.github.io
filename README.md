### Let's Recycle App

<span style="font-size: 160%; ">
This app allows a customer to make an online request 
AO for an appliance recycling collection from their 
home address. It is also possible to request a collection 
from a neighbourhood address for an appliance that has been abandoned.
<br />
<br />
The customer can choose a suitable collection time from a selection
of time slots which are algorithmically generated by matching 
AOs scheduled delivery routes to the recycling pick up address.
