# Let's Recycle App

This app allows a customer to make an online request 
to AO for an appliance recycling collection from 
their home address. It is also possible to request a 
collection from a neighbourhood address for an appliance 
that has been abandoned.

The customer can choose a suitable collection time from a selection
of time slots which are algorithmically generated by matching 
AOs scheduled delivery routes to the recycling pick up address.
